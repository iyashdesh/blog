22/03/2021 - GOAL
I want to become an rl researcher.
My maths is bad.
I need to complete this:

15/11/2020-22/04/2021 phd dilemma
disclaimer: my opinion.
tldr: not now
goal: I want to become a ml/(d)rl scientist and/or engineer.
let investments={phd rl/drl,
				kaggle gm,
				swe,
				publish research,
				maths,
				rl theory}
let power law=return of one investment>total return of remaining investments combined
power law->which investment's return > total return of remaining investments combined

phd rl/drl:	research=add novel knowledge node of knowledge tree. added novel knowledge node not necessarily practically useful->time wasted
			I need funding/scholarship,math (I'm not good in maths(and programming)...yet),most phd deadlines have passed,phd quality is largest dependent on supervisor quality,
				opportunity cost in non-academic life aspects,
				not necessarily applied (ideal:theory understanding+applied programming. I am not exceptional to achieve both simutaneously(i.e. phd rl + Kaggle GM)),
			Good career development.
			conclusion: uncomfortably risky
			
kaggle gm: 	applied ml competitions. prize money implies serious ml work. learn most practical ml techniques,top-down approach (maths and programming),low risk,community,improve ml programming. improved ml programming->improves programming competence and confidence and ml-related job performance.
			competition=performance evaluation in relation to other contestants on a national and international scale. win competition->learning xp (improved ml programming) and distinguished performance->convince potential employers to hire a candidate.
			=>win competition->convince potential employers to hire a candidate
			Good career development
			conclusion: very low risk, become competent in useful applied ml programming techniques,improve ml-related job performance

note: two above completed->remaining is taken care of

conclusion: Kaggle GM is sufficient for a 'good' career in ml. At a later time, re-evaluate phd decision.
